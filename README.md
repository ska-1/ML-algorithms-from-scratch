## Introduction

Understanding machine learning algorithms at a granular level is crucial for grasping their mechanics and effectively applying them. This project offers straightforward implementations of various machine learning algorithms using Python and foundational libraries like NumPy.

## Implemented Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines
  - k-Nearest Neighbors

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - k-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis

- **Neural Networks:**
  - Feedforward Neural Network
  - Convolutional Neural Network

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ska-1/ML-algorithms-from-scratch.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ML--Code-from-Scratch
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

*Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file is present and lists all necessary dependencies.*

## Usage

Each algorithm is accompanied by a demonstration script illustrating its application. To execute a specific example, run:

```bash
python examples/algorithm_name_example.py
```

*Replace `algorithm_name_example.py` with the actual script name.*

For a comprehensive understanding, refer to the docstrings and comments within each implementation.
